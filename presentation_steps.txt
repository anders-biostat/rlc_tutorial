Tutorial:

- CiteSeq data: describe, show paper
- Subset to human cells
- Calculate count sums (and size factors)
- Plot variance versus mean
- then plot var/mean vs mean

- How to individual genes look like?
- Let's pick a gene with 'identify', then plot it's counts against the countsums
- How can we automatize this?

- Linked charts: Installation from github
- Open a page (use_viewer=FALSE)
- place a simple scatter plot, var/mean vs mean
- set log scale
- adjust point size
- demonstrate on_click

- Set a 'gene' global variable to some random gene, e.g. "CD3E"
- Add a second scatter plot to plot counts for gene versus countsum
- Make x axis logarithmic
- Add title=gene

- Set layout to 'table2x2'
- Place at "A1" and "A2"

- Demonstrate changing the plot: Change the 'gene' variable, then call updateChart

- Now put this into on_click for the first plot.

- Play with it: What kind of data can we see?

- Recap!

- Add t-SNE
- add colourValue parameter to t-SNE
- add t-SNE to update call
- add sqrt to colourValue

- Show 'getMarked'
- Use it to color genes in a t-SNE plot in R
- Use it to calculate mean differences

- Show rlc/test2  

- Show t-SNE vs UMAP
